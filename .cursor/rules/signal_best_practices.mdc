- Use clear, contextual signal names that describe their purpose (e.g., player_health_changed)
- Utilize typed signals to improve safety and IDE assistance (e.g., signal item_collected(item_name: String))
- Connect signals in code for dynamic nodes, and in the editor for static relationships
- Avoid overusing signals - reserve them for important events, not frequent updates
- Pass only necessary data through signal arguments, avoiding entire node references when possible
- Use an autoload "EventBus" singleton for global signals that need to reach distant nodes
- Minimize signal bubbling through multiple parent nodes
- Always disconnect signals when nodes are freed to prevent memory leaks
- Document signals with comments explaining their purpose and parameters
