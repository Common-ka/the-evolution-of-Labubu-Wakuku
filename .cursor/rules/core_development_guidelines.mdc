- Use strict typing in GDScript for better error detection and IDE support
- Implement \_ready() and other lifecycle functions with explicit super() calls
- Use @onready annotations instead of direct node references in \_ready()
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible
- Use signals for loose coupling between nodes
- Follow Godot's node naming conventions (PascalCase for nodes, snake_case for methods)
